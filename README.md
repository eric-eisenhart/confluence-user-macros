## What are Confluence User Macros ?

If you run your own Confluence instance (Server or Data Center) you can create custom “User Macros”, little scripts that can be included in pages creating content on the fly. With those macros you can create simple HTML code as well as utilize Velocity code accessing information from your Confluence database.

I will not address the basics of writing a user macro here. That is well documented in the Confluence documentation here.
